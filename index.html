      Happy birthday Greta! We haven't talked in like a month and im coding this prior to talking to you again.
      Im making this because I want to one up you for the card you gave me at christmas and making a website seemed to be the most me way of doing it. 
      Do you like it? Ive enjoyed making it very much and the anonoymous person I pitched the idea too thought it was really cool too. 
      If everything is going according to plan, You should only recieve the present im giving you, an Orange (fufufu) and piece of paper with a QR code on it.
      Im having a lot of fun making this and im learning new code to do this. 
      It took me a large deal of time to just get the image not to move and the text to wrap around it. 
      Don't even get me started on getting the website set up and the mutiple websites to work together.
      I dont know what the QR code will end up being but the first version had a picture of kanna in the middle.
      Then the second had a light hentai ahageo face in the background.
      I'll probably change it to a picture of a lewd loli or lewd kanna.
      This card will be a lot longer because as you are very aware my handw writting is <strong>HORRIBLE</strong> (like that effect?).
      So I would be able to write very little and it wouldn't encapsulate all that I want to tell.
      I wish I had photos of you and I together but I don't have any.
      But I do have a few of your reactions throughout our talks together.

     For your birthday My gift to you is a Jiji puzzle. I knew you loved jijis voice and personaility from the italian dub of kikis delivery girl as a child. 
      So I thought I would get you something ghibli themed. It was going to be Jiji or totoro. 
      I went to forbidden planet one time to get you a gift and eoghan was with me and he gave me dirty looks i was doing to get you this totoro toy plushie or this towel with a nice a cute jini stiched onto it.
      But eoghan said it was stupid and i shouldnt spend 13 euro on someone who isnt my girlfriend. 
      But I found the jiji puzzle online i thought it was perfect. We both won those puzzles in math class when we did that quiz with Toby.

      My quest to get this puzzle was a one of great struggle, The toy is from japan so the only way to get it was through amazon.
      I had to create an amazon account which was hard enough because I didn't have half of the details I needed. 
      I couldn't use my parents paypal which I would usually use and pay them in cash so I had to set up my own pay pal.
      So I made a paypal account and I had to verify my bank account by telling paypal what were the two transaction amounts they just added to my account.
      So I went off the bank to get a bank statement but my bank is like fuck you, you can only get bank statements online. 
      So I had to set up online banking, I had to call the bank and tell them all my details and set up a new pin. 
      Once i set up online banking and paypal, I ordered the Jiji puzzle on amazon. Im in america right now but It should be coming soon after I get home.
