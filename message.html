      I don't know how to start this so this is how im starting it, Super meta bitch. 
      I don't know how to articulate what I want to put in here all I know is what I feel in here
      I want to say thank you for being close to me for all this time.
      Even thought we've had our problems all stemming from me, Im super mega grateful that you stuck by me through my darkest moments It truly means a lot.
      As the time of writing this I dont know whats hurting you so much, But I have your back no matter what.
      I have discovered over this past month that, life moves on whether I want it to or not and I don't know what curve balls the future will throw my way (hopefully good ones).
      But I do know the one thing I want the same is you being in my life and i dont know what form it will take but I want it none the less.
      Thanks for putting up with me and I want you to know that In this moment and all future moments I will always be grateful and chersih you for being in my life
      Thank you and stay being the amazing loli you are!
