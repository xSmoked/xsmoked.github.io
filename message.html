      I don't know how to articulate what I want to put in here all I know is what I feel in here
      I want to say thank you for being close to me for all this time.
      Even thought we've had our problems all stemming from me, Im super mega grateful that you stook by me through my darkest moments It truly means a lot.
      As the time of writing this I havent talked to you yet and I dont know how its going to go and I don't know how you've been.
      But I have discovered over this past month that I dont need you to keep on living. 
      Life moves on whether I want it to or not and I don't know what curve balls the future will throw my way.
      But I do know I want you to be in my life whatever form it may take.
      Thanks for putting up with me and I want you to know that In this moment and all future moments I will always be grateful and chersih you for being in my life
      Thank you and stay being the amazing loli you are!
